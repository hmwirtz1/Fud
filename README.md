FUD!

The goal of FUD is to manage food inventory and cost of gross sales. As well as provide options for how to order your food products, and calculate the risk of running out of product given inventory on hand and a sales projection.

Usage:
Currently it is command line only. FUD reads input from a text file, and requires some variable input from the user. Such as the type of product, amount of product used for a given amount of sales, amount of product in a case of product and the cost of said product. 

Feature Goals: 
Implement UI using dear IMGUI and the directx12 API. 
Offer tiered ordering options for your products with various levels of risks for running out of product.
Ex: Tier 1 has highest profit margins, but also higher risk of running out of a given product. 
Tier 2 would be less profitable but also less likely to run out of product.
Create a sales database to more accurately forcast sales for a given week.
Create a database of products, with costs and usages associated for said product.
